# Instructions for Production Environment

## Creating a Local Repository
To create a local copy of the project, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the latest version of Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the files.
3. Run the following command. Git will automatically create a folder with the repository name and download the files.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaksymukNatalia/Schedule.git

## Set Environment

After cloning the repository, change `.envsample` to `.env`.

```bash
mv .envsample .env

Set the appropriate values in the `.env` file.

## Docker Setup

Download and install the latest version of Docker from [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Application Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.

2. Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    After the build is finished, access the application using:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/public/semesters
    ```

- **Issue: Unable to start Docker containers.**
  - *Solution:* Check if Docker is running, and ensure no other processes are using the required ports.

- **Issue: Incorrect data in the application.**
  - *Solution:* Verify the values of environment variables in the `.env` file and restart the application.
